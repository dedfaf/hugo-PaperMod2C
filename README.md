# PaperMod2C

This repository is created to apply the changes from [pull request #675](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/pull/675)(Toc on the side) to the [Hugo PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod). It may occasionally be synchronized with the upstream repository in the future.

Additionally, I’ve added a feature for a large image on the homepage (For personal use). Add 

```
params:
  ...

  homeInfoParams:
    Title: ...
    Content: ...
    Image: "Your Image Url Here"

```

in `hugo.yaml` (or other formats) to enable it.
